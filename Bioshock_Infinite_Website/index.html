                    <p>In July 1912, Booker DeWitt arrives in Columbia. In the city, he is pursued by Columbia's authorities, who recognize him as a prophesied "False Shepherd" who will corrupt Elizabeth and overthrow Columbia. Freeing Elizabeth from her tower, Booker narrowly evades her captor, The Songbird. Commandeering an airship, Booker promises to take Elizabeth to Paris; when she realizes they are going to New York City to fulfill Booker's debts, Elizabeth knocks him out. Booker awakens to find the airship under the control of Daisy Fitzroy, who offers to return the ship if Booker helps her arm the Vox Populi.</p>

                    <h2>Booker Dewitt</h2>
                    <p>Booker DeWitt is the protagonist of BioShock Infinite. He is a private investigator and, prior to his reluctant arrival in Columbia, a former soldier and Pinkerton agent. Booker is offered a deal to wipe away his debts if he goes to Columbia and retrieves a girl imprisoned there. Over the course of the story, Booker reveals his past experiences and shows his ability to make decisions independent of the player. Unlike Jack and Subject Delta, Booker has his own personality rather than being a silent and faceless avatar for the player.

                    <h2>Elizabeth</h2>
                    <p>lizabeth is the deuteragonist. She is a 19 to 20 year old woman who has been imprisoned in the flying city of Columbia since she was an infant and who Booker DeWitt is sent to retrieve and bring to New York City unharmed. She is guarded by Songbird, a monstrous, winged creature who was both her keeper and only friend during childhood. However, she began to hate him as she grew up, seeing him as a warden prohibiting her freedom. Elizabeth has the power to manipulate Tears that exist in the fabric of time.</p>

                    <h2>Song Bird</h2>
                    <p>When Elizabeth was imprisoned in Columbia, Songbird was created for the sole purpose of keeping her imprisoned within her Tower, and became the most feared creature in the city. During that time, it was Elizabeth's only companion, bringing her such things as books, toys, food, and drinks. Although it held her captive, the creature was her caretaker and protector. As a child, Elizabeth viewed Songbird as a friend, but later came to hate it for keeping her imprisoned. When she escapes, Songbird's intent is bringing her back, even if it means destroying anyone and anything near her, including Booker DeWitt and even the tower that she's kept in.</p>
